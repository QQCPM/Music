## First Experiment (30 minutes)

Try this concrete experiment right now:

### "Do activations differ for happy vs. sad music?"

```python
from audiocraft.models import MusicGen
from src.utils.activation_utils import ActivationExtractor

# Load model
model = MusicGen.get_pretrained('facebook/musicgen-large')
model.set_generation_params(duration=8)

# Create extractor
extractor = ActivationExtractor(model, layers=[0, 6, 12, 18, 23])

# Generate happy music
happy_wav = extractor.generate(["upbeat cheerful pop music"])
happy_activations = extractor.get_activations()

# Generate sad music
extractor.clear_activations()
sad_wav = extractor.generate(["melancholic sad piano ballad"])
sad_activations = extractor.get_activations()

# Compare layer 12
from src.utils.activation_utils import cosine_similarity
similarity = cosine_similarity(
happy_activations['layer_12'],
sad_activations['layer_12']
)
print(f"Similarity: {similarity:.4f}")
# If < 0.9, emotions are represented differently!
```

## Performance Tips

### GPU Memory Optimization
```python
# Use smaller model for testing
model = MusicGen.get_pretrained('facebook/musicgen-small') # 8GB VRAM

# Shorter generation
model.set_generation_params(duration=5) # 5 seconds

# Store activations on CPU
extractor = ActivationExtractor(model, store_on_cpu=True)

# Clear cache
import torch
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

### Speed Up Development
- Test with `musicgen-small` first
- Use shorter audio durations (5-8 seconds)
- Sample fewer layers initially
- Generate smaller batches

---

## Troubleshooting

### "AttributeError: 'LMModel' object has no attribute 'layers'"
**Fixed!** Make sure you're using the updated code with `model.lm.transformer.layers`

### "CUDA out of memory"
- Use `musicgen-small` or `musicgen-medium`
- Reduce duration: `model.set_generation_params(duration=5)`
- Enable CPU storage: `ActivationExtractor(model, store_on_cpu=True)`

### "Generation is very slow"
- Check GPU is being used: `python3 scripts/check_gpu.py`
- On Apple Silicon, make sure MPS is active
- Consider cloud GPU (Google Colab, Paperspace)

---

### This Week
1. Read [docs/phase0_roadmap.md](docs/phase0_roadmap.md) Week 1-2 section
2. Start ARENA tutorials on superposition
3. Generate 20-30 music samples with varied emotions
4. Explore different prompts and observe model behavior

### This Month
1. Complete Phase 0 Week 1-4 (mechanistic interpretability + MusicGen mastery)

3. Read key papers on SAEs and activation steering
4. Start thinking about your Phase 1 experiments

## Core Research Question

**"Do music generation models 'understand' emotion, or just correlate patterns?"**

### How You'll Answer It

**Evidence for "understanding"**:
- Emotions form linear, separable representations
- Causal pathways match human music perception
- Activation steering produces coherent, emotionally-shifted music

**Evidence for "pattern matching"**:
- Emotion representations are entangled/polysemantic
- No coherent causal structure
- Steering produces incoherent or unchanged music

**Either result is novel and publishable!**
