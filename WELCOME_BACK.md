## What We Discovered (Phase 0 Complete!)

### The Breakthrough

**Emotions ARE encoded in MusicGen - we found them in T5 text embeddings!**

| Finding | Result |
|---------|--------|
| **Classification accuracy** | **96%** |
| **Encoding location** | T5 text embeddings (768-dim) |
| **Signal strength** | 6.6% differentiation (p < 0.000001) |
| **Key insight** | Emotions in INPUT (text), not processing (transformer) |

### What This Means

**Original hypothesis (wrong)**: Emotions in transformer hidden states
**Actual discovery (correct)**: Emotions in T5 text embeddings

**Implication**: Phase 1 will train SAE on T5 embeddings (easier + stronger signal!)

## Quick Start (Next 15 Minutes)

### Option A: Start Phase 1 Training

```bash
# 1. Navigate and activate
cd "/Users/lending/Documents/AI PRJ/MusicGen"
source venv/bin/activate

# 2. Train SAE (10 minutes)
python3 experiments/train_sae_on_t5_embeddings.py

# 3. Analyze features (2 minutes)
python3 experiments/analyze_sae_features.py
```

**Expected outcome**: 50-100 emotion-selective features discovered!

### Option B: Review Phase 0 Results

Read these in order:
1. [PHASE0_TO_PHASE1_SUMMARY.md](PHASE0_TO_PHASE1_SUMMARY.md) - What we found
2. [SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md) - How it works
3. [PHASE1_ROADMAP.md](PHASE1_ROADMAP.md) - What's next

## Key Concepts Refresher

### What We Built

**Sparse Autoencoder (SAE)**:
- Takes 768-dim T5 embedding
- Expands to 6144 sparse features (8x overcomplete)
- Finds monosemantic emotion features
- Example: Feature 42 = "joyful celebration"

### Why This Works

**T5 Embeddings** Encode emotion (96% accuracy)
**SAE** Disentangle superposition
**Result** Interpretable emotion features

### Phase 1 Goal

Find 50-100 features like:
- Feature 42: "joyful celebration" (activates for happy)
- Feature 108: "melancholic longing" (activates for sad)
- Feature 221: "peaceful calm" (activates for calm)
- Feature 334: "intense energy" (activates for energetic)

## Phase 0 Metrics (Quick Reference)

| Metric | Value | Meaning |
|--------|-------|---------|
| T5 Classification | 96% | Can predict emotion from text embedding |
| Between-emotion sim | 49% | Different emotions ARE different |
| Within-emotion sim | 56% | Same emotions ARE similar |
| Differentiation | 6.6% | Statistically significant (p < 0.000001) |
| Dataset size | 100 | 25 samples per emotion |

**Verdict**: Strong emotion encoding confirmed in T5 embeddings

---

## Phase 1 Targets

| Metric | Target | Status |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Selective features | 50-100 | To be achieved |
| Reconstruction MSE | < 0.01 | To be achieved |
| Active features (L0) | 50-200 | To be achieved |
| Top selectivity | > 4.0x | To be achieved |
| Interpretable features | 10+ per emotion | To be achieved |

**Timeline**: 3 weeks (Week 1: train, Week 2: scale, Week 3: validate)

## ️ What's in Archive?

`archive/phase0_development/` contains outdated files from when we were searching for the signal:

- **NEXT_STEPS_FINAL.md** - Outdated (assumed weak signal)
- **SOLUTION_STRATEGY.md** - Outdated (search strategy, now unnecessary)
- **CRITICAL_REALITY_CHECK.md** - Outdated (0.47% signal in transformer, but T5 has 6.6%!)
- **debug_activation_extraction.py** - Old debugging script
- **validate_results_critically.py** - Led to T5 discovery

**These files are kept for historical reference but are NOT current.**

---

## System Status

```
Phase 0: Complete (Emotions found in T5 embeddings, 96% accuracy)
Phase 1: Ready (SAE infrastructure built and tested)
Phase 2: Planned (Activation steering using discovered features)
Phase 3: Planned (Causal pathway analysis)
```

**Next action**: Run Phase 1 training or review documentation

## If You're Confused...

### "What was Phase 0?"
Validated that emotions ARE encoded (96% accuracy in T5 embeddings)
Read: [PHASE0_TO_PHASE1_SUMMARY.md](PHASE0_TO_PHASE1_SUMMARY.md)

### "What is Phase 1?"
Train SAE to find monosemantic emotion features
Read: [PHASE1_QUICKSTART.md](PHASE1_QUICKSTART.md)

### "How does the SAE work?"
Disentangles superposition to find interpretable features
Read: [SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md](SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md) - Section: "Sparse Autoencoder"

### "Where's the code?"
All implementation in `src/` and `experiments/`
Read: [START_HERE.md](START_HERE.md)

### "What are the old files about?"
Archive contains outdated work when we thought signal was weak
We discovered strong signal (96% accuracy) - those files are obsolete
