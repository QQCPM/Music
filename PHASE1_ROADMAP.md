# Phase 1: Sparse Autoencoder Training - Complete Roadmap

**Status**: READY TO BEGIN ✅
**Duration**: 2-3 weeks
**Goal**: Train SAEs on T5 text embeddings to discover monosemantic emotion-encoding features

---

## 🎯 Revised Research Focus

### Key Discovery from Phase 0

**Emotions are encoded in T5 TEXT EMBEDDINGS, not transformer activations**

| Representation | Between-Emotion Similarity | Differentiation | Status |
|----------------|---------------------------|-----------------|---------|
| **T5 text embeddings** | 49.4% | **50% range** | ✅ **STRONG** |
| **Transformer activations** | 94.6% | 5% range | ⚠️ WEAK |

**Implication**: Phase 1 targets T5 embedding space (768-dim), not transformer layers (2048-dim)

**Benefits**:
- ✅ **Smaller dimensionality**: 768 vs 2048 (easier to train)
- ✅ **Stronger signal**: 96% classification accuracy vs ~50%
- ✅ **Clear interpretation**: Text encoding is more interpretable than transformer states

## 📅 Week-by-Week Plan

### Week 1: Initial SAE Training & Hyperparameter Search

**Days 1-2: Baseline Training**

Run initial training with default hyperparameters:

```bash
cd "/Users/lending/Documents/AI PRJ/MusicGen"
source venv/bin/activate
python3 experiments/train_sae_on_t5_embeddings.py
```

**Expected outcomes**:
- Training time: ~5-10 minutes
- L0 (active features): 50-200 per sample (target: sparse!)
- Reconstruction loss: < 0.01 (good reconstruction)
- Validation loss: Should decrease and plateau

**Success criteria**:
- ✅ Training completes without errors
- ✅ Reconstruction loss < 0.02
- ✅ L0 < 500 (< 10% of 6144 features active)
- ✅ < 100 dead features at end of training

**Days 3-4: Hyperparameter Sweep**

Test different L1 coefficients to find optimal sparsity/reconstruction trade-off:

| L1 Coefficient | Expected Sparsity | Expected Reconstruction |
|----------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| 1e-3 | Medium (~300 active) | Good |
| 3e-3 | High (~100 active) | Medium |
| 1e-2 | Very high (~50 active) | Poor |
| 3e-4 | Low (~500 active) | Excellent |

**To run sweep**:
```python
# Edit train_sae_on_t5_embeddings.py CONFIG
for l1 in [1e-3, 3e-3, 1e-2, 3e-4]:
    CONFIG['l1_coefficient'] = l1
    # Run training
```

**Choose best model** based on:
1. Reconstruction loss < 0.01 (must reconstruct well)
2. L0 = 50-200 (sparse enough to be interpretable)
3. Dead features < 10% (most features should be useful)

**Days 5-7: Feature Analysis**

Run analysis on best model:

```bash
python3 experiments/analyze_sae_features.py
```

**Expected findings**:
- 50-200 emotion-selective features (selectivity > 2.0)
- Features cluster by emotion in heatmap
- Some features activate for specific emotion words (e.g., "joyful", "sad")

**Week 1 Deliverable**:
- ✅ Trained SAE model with good sparsity/reconstruction trade-off
- ✅ Initial feature analysis showing emotion selectivity
- ✅ Training curves and metrics saved

---

### Week 2: Scale Up Dataset & Retrain

**Days 1-3: Generate More Prompts**

Current dataset: 100 prompts (25 per emotion)
Target: 400-500 prompts (100-125 per emotion)

**Strategy**: Expand prompt diversity

```python
# Create experiments/generate_diverse_prompts.py
# Generate prompts with:
# - Different instruments (piano, guitar, orchestra, electronic)
# - Different genres (classical, pop, rock, jazz, ambient)
# - Different intensity levels (subtle, moderate, intense)
# - Different descriptive styles (adjectives, scenes, metaphors)

emotions = {
    'happy': [
        # Instrumental
        'happy piano melody',
        'cheerful acoustic guitar',
        'joyful orchestral piece',

        # Genre-based
        'upbeat pop song',
        'energetic dance music',
        'bright jazz tune',

        # Intensity
        'subtly optimistic music',
        'moderately cheerful tune',
        'intensely jubilant celebration',

        # Scene-based
        'sunny day at the beach music',
        'children playing in park',
        'birthday party celebration',

        # ... 100+ total for happy
    ],
    # ... similar for sad, calm, energetic
}
```

**Days 4-5: Extract T5 Embeddings for New Prompts**

Modify and run `extract_t5_embeddings_at_scale.py`:

```bash
python3 experiments/extract_t5_embeddings_at_scale.py \
    --output-dir results/t5_embeddings_500 \
    --num-prompts 500
```

**Expected results**:
- 500 T5 embeddings (125 per emotion)
- Maintained differentiation (between-similarity ~0.49)
- Improved diversity (lower within-similarity)

**Days 6-7: Retrain SAE on Larger Dataset**

Run training with 500 samples:

```bash
# Update CONFIG in train_sae_on_t5_embeddings.py
CONFIG['data_dir'] = 'results/t5_embeddings_500'

python3 experiments/train_sae_on_t5_embeddings.py
```

**Expected improvements**:
- More robust features (less overfitting)
- Better coverage of emotion space
- More monosemantic features

**Week 2 Deliverable**:
- ✅ 500-prompt T5 embedding dataset
- ✅ SAE trained on larger, more diverse dataset
- ✅ Feature analysis showing improved interpretability

---

### Week 3: Feature Interpretation & Validation

**Days 1-2: Manual Feature Inspection**

Create `experiments/inspect_features_manually.py`:

```python
# For each top selective feature:
# 1. Find prompts that activate it most
# 2. Find prompts that don't activate it
# 3. Determine what concept it encodes

# Example output:
# Feature 42 (happy-selective, selectivity: 5.2x):
#   Top activating prompts:
#     - "joyful celebration music" (activation: 0.82)
#     - "happy children playing" (activation: 0.78)
#     - "cheerful upbeat melody" (activation: 0.75)
#
#   Low activating prompts:
#     - "sad melancholic piano" (activation: 0.01)
#     - "calm meditation ambient" (activation: 0.03)
#
#   Interpretation: Encodes "JOYFUL CELEBRATION" concept
```

**Goal**: Find 10-20 clearly interpretable features per emotion

**Days 3-4: Feature Intervention Experiments**

Test if features are **causally important**:

```python
# experiments/test_feature_causality.py

# Experiment 1: Activation clamping
# - Clamp happy-selective feature to 0 when encoding "happy music"
# - Expect: Reconstruction loses "happy" characteristics

# Experiment 2: Feature transplanting
# - Take sad prompt embedding
# - Add activation from happy-selective feature
# - Expect: Reconstruction gains "happy" characteristics

# Experiment 3: Feature ablation
# - Zero out all features except top-5 for emotion
# - Check if reconstruction still captures emotion
```

**Days 5-6: Quantitative Validation**

**Test 1: Feature Orthogonality**
- Are emotion features independent?
- Compute correlation between feature activations
- Expected: Low correlation (< 0.3)

**Test 2: Feature Stability**
- Train 3 SAEs with different random seeds
- Do similar features emerge?
- Compute feature similarity across models

**Test 3: Generalization**
- Generate 100 NEW prompts (not in training set)
- Extract T5 embeddings
- Run through SAE
- Check if features still selective

**Day 7: Write Phase 1 Report**

Document findings:

1. **Summary**
   - Number of interpretable features found
   - Selectivity scores
   - Example features with descriptions

2. **Validation Results**
   - Causal intervention outcomes
   - Stability across random seeds
   - Generalization to new prompts

3. **Comparison to Phase 0**
   - Phase 0: Showed emotions ARE encoded (96% accuracy)
   - Phase 1: Identified WHERE/HOW emotions are encoded (specific features)

4. **Next Steps for Phase 2**
   - Use features for MusicGen activation steering
   - Test if steering these features changes generated music
   - Validate with acoustic analysis + human eval

**Week 3 Deliverable**:
- ✅ 10-20 interpretable features per emotion
- ✅ Causal validation of features
- ✅ Stability and generalization tests passed
- ✅ Phase 1 complete report

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

## 🔧 Hyperparameters to Tune

### Critical Parameters

| Parameter | Default | Range to Test | Impact |
|-----------|---------|---------------|--------|
| `l1_coefficient` | 1e-3 | [3e-4, 1e-3, 3e-3, 1e-2] | Sparsity level |
| `expansion_factor` | 8 | [4, 8, 12, 16] | Feature capacity |
| `learning_rate` | 1e-3 | [3e-4, 1e-3, 3e-3] | Training speed |
| `batch_size` | 16 | [8, 16, 32] | Stability |

### Less Critical (Use Defaults)

- `dead_feature_threshold`: 100 steps
- `decoder_norm`: True
- `encoder_init_scale`: 0.1
- `patience`: 50 epochs

**Tuning Strategy**:
1. Start with defaults
2. If too sparse (L0 < 20): Decrease `l1_coefficient`
3. If not sparse enough (L0 > 500): Increase `l1_coefficient`
4. If poor reconstruction: Decrease `l1_coefficient` or increase `expansion_factor`
5. If too many dead features: Decrease `dead_feature_threshold` or reinit more frequently

## 🎯 Phase 2 Preview

**If Phase 1 succeeds**, proceed to Phase 2: **Activation Steering**

**Goal**: Use discovered features to control MusicGen's emotional output

**Approach**:
1. Take trained SAE features
2. Identify "emotion steering vectors" in T5 embedding space
3. Add steering vectors to MusicGen's T5 conditioning
4. Generate music and validate emotion shift

**Example experiment**:
```python
# Start with neutral prompt
prompt = "instrumental music"

# Add "happy" steering vector
happy_feature_vector = sae_decoder[:, happy_feature_42]  # Feature 42 = "joyful"
steered_embedding = t5_embedding + 2.0 * happy_feature_vector

# Generate with MusicGen using steered embedding
# Expected: Music sounds happier even though prompt is neutral
```

**Success criteria for Phase 2**:
- Steering changes CLAP similarity scores for emotion
- Human evaluators detect emotion shift
- Acoustic features (tempo, mode) change as expected
